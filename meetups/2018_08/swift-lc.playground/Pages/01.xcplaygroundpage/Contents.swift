/*:
 How could we represent integers?
 
 Let's consider the natural numbers (whole numbers from zero onward). How can we define a formula for calculating any natural number using a minimal number of components or "types of things that we compose together".
 
 Let's try just using three symbols: "0", "1", and "+".
 
 0 = 0
 1 = 1 + 0
 2 = 1 + 1 + 0
 3 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 0
 
 Imagine we have a function called `succ` that given an input number, returns the next number.
 
 0 = zero
 1 = succ(zero)
 2 = succ(succ(zero))
 3 = succ(succ(succ(zero)))
 ...
 
 Given zero, any other natural number is just N successors of zero!
 
 What do we need to write this in Swift? We need the successor function and we need zero. But wait! We can't write a successor function because we decided not to use addition and we can't use zero because we decided not to use numbers! That's OK. The beauty of higher-order functions is that we can just pretend we have things when we don't.
 
 Let's make some numbers.

/*:
 What about booleans? What does a boolean do?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Booleans allow us to make choices. It is either "this" or "that". If true, we do A. If false we do B. If we think of an `if else` statement as a FUNCTION, whenever the input is true, we always do the `if` part and whenever the input is false, we always do the `else` part. We can each "part" of the `if else` condition as a FUNCTION:
 
     if (someBoolean) {
        trueFUNCTION()
     } else {
        falseFUNCTION()
     }
 
 We know that a boolean is eventually going to be a FUNCTION since everything is FUNCTIONs. When we think about it like this, an `if else` statement is really just a FUNCTION that takes three arguments: a boolean, a true FUNCTION, and a false FUNCTION. So `if else` just takes three "FUNCTIONS".
 
 What about just plain `if` statements with no `else`?
 
 These are really just `if else` statements where the else part does nothing.
 
 What about `else if` statements or switches?
 
 Every `else if` statement can be rewritten as a group of nested `if else` statements! The same logic applies to switches and pattern matching. Essentially, they are just sugar for the binary `if else`.
 
 Therefore, we will only concern ourselves with constructing the `if else` FUNCTION.

 Subtraction, multiplication, division, etc can all be implemented as well. However, Swift's type system will put up a good fight because this type of code is neither safe nor elegant. If you want to explore this concept further I suggest using a language like Ruby or Javascript.
