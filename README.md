# Monthly Swift Meetups

This repo contains the agendas and content for all our monthly meetups.

#### Looking for content?

Check the `meetup/` directory.

#### Speaking?

- Be sure to add your content to the appropriate `meetup/` directory preferably before the meetup so others can follow along.
- If the directory for your meetup doesn't exist run `bin/create`.
